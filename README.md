In this project the user searches for a specific repository and saves it in its list. So he can navigate to that repository page providing more details about it.

And to add more challenges in this project paging and filtering was done to improve user interaction.

This project was built using the Next.js framework due to its server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) advantages, which ensure fast load times and a smooth user experience.
